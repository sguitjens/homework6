## Instructions

Build a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly
```

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.

* Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* Your app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* Display the following under current weather conditions:

  * City

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

  * Wind speed

  * UV index

* Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. 

* Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:

  * Date

  * Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

  * Temperature

  * Humidity

### Hints

* Create multiple functions within your application to handle the different parts of the dashboard:

  * Current conditions
  
  * 5-Day Forecast
  
  * Search history

  * UV index

* You will need to make more than one AJAX call.

* You will need to hardcode some of the parameters in the API's URL. User input will determine some of the other parameters.

* Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
